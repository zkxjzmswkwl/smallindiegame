Server thread outline

* `Server` loop runs on main thread
* `Server` instantiation results in the creation and subsequent running of `World` thread.
* `Server` loop receives incoming messages, deserializes them into `Packet` objects and uses
  d's messaging protocol to pass them to the `World` thread.
* The `World` thread then processes those messages and invokes the corresponding logic for each.
* ....profit?
